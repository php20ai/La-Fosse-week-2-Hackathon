Rock-Paper-Scissors

Get Human Player Name
HumanName = Human Player Name
Display "Hi ${HumanName}, 
          Welcome to Rock 
          Paper Scissors Game ?"

Display Instruction of game:

Display Are you Ready to Play?
        Type Y for Yes
        Type N for No/Quit

If user types N display: Are you sure you want to Quit ? Y/N
         If user Types Y then Quit Game 
         If user types N, then display:
              "Are you Ready to Play?
               Type Y for Yes
               Type N for No/Quit"


If user types Y, then go ahead with game.

If the input is not Y and is not N, then request user to type either
Y or N.

Assuming user typed Y:


Request user to choose one of the following options: 
    1.Rock
    2.Paper
    3.Scissors
Store user input as PlayerInput, and put the PlayerInput into lowercase.

Store above options in dictionary i.e.:

objects = {1: "rock", 2: "paper", 3: "scissors"}

Create a collection (array) containing rock, paper and scissors:

stationary = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]

The computer will use the stationary array to choose either rock, paper or scissors:

create a function that will give a random whole number between and including 0 and 2.
This function is shown below:

function randInt(min, max) {
    let mathRand = Math.rand() 
    while (mathRand===1) {
        let mathRand = Math.rand() 
    }
    let rand = ((mathRand)*(max-min)) + min
    return Math.floor(rand)
    
}

let compRand = randInt(0,3)   // randInt(0,3) will give a whole number between and including 0 and 2.

// The reason why the arguments of randInt are 0 and 3 is shown below:
// The computer will randomly choose an object from the stationary array (that is created in line 43)
// However for the computer to get an object from stationary array, the computer needs the index (which is the location of that object
in array) of that object in stationary array, and for computer to randomly get an object from stationary array we need to give a random index (random number) between and including 
0 and 2, when computer recieves that random number, the computer will get the object in stationary that has index equal to the random number. .
//.

Create computerInput that will store either rock, paper or scissors, shown below:

let computerInput = stationary[compRand]

Create count variable that will count number of rounds:
let count = 0
Create playerScore and compScore that will store the score of player and computer, respectively.
let playerScore = 0 
let compScore = 0

Join playerInput (in line 36) and compInput (in line 72) together:

let result = playerInput + "|" + compInput
Create while loop and switch statement:

while (count < 10) {
    switch (result) {
        case "paper|rock":
        case "scissors|paper":
        case "rock|scissors":
        playerScore +=1
        count+=1
        console.log("You have won this round, 
                      1 point to you!")
        break

        case "rock|paper":
        case "paper|scissors":
        case "scissors|rock":
        compScore+=1
        count+=1
        console.log("Computer has won this round,
                    Computer gets 1 point ")
        break

        case "rock|rock":
        case "paper|paper":
        case "scissors|scissors":
        count+=1
        console.log("It's a tie.")
        break
    }
}

if (playerScore > compScore) {
    console.log(`You have won your score is ${}`)
} else if (compScore > playerScore) {
    console.log(`Computer has won.`)
} else {
    console.log(It's a tie.)
}
